                        	<a href="http://www.wyng43.com" target="_blank" style="color:#c0304d">Wyng43</a> is a Hong-Kong-based angel investing company, where I worked for two months last summer. I had been given the chance to fully design and start the development of the company's website from scratch.  
                        	<br>

                        	<a href="http://www.hibluesky.co" target="_blank" style="color:#c0304d">BlueSky</a> instead focuses on the conservation of energy through behaviour change, for whose website I have improved its SEO ranking.
                        	I have also researched for potentials clients and actively participated in weekly brainstormings.
                        	In a team instead, we came up with a functioning business model for a self-sustained Hong Kong Universities Sustainability Challenge, sponsored by them, and also with a behavioural plan to reduce electricity consumption in their office by at least 30%.

I thus need to control that the needs of the society are fullfilled but at the same time I don't have to lose sight of the bigger picture, and I do this by noting down the transactions done, those refunded and those to make.
                            <br>
                            The committee also holds weekly meetings in which we draw conclusions on what has been done so far and how to go about the following week, thus brainstorming and speaking up.
